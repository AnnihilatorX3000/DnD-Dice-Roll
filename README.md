# DnD-Dice-Roll
A program created for my brother in calculating the possible rolls and probabilities after rolling some n_i-sided dice for Dungeons and Dragons.

For example, one may roll three 4-sided dice and two 6-sided dice, and the program will calculate the probabilities for obtaining each rollable number after rolling the five dice.
